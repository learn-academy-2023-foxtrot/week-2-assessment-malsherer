# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions: MS

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter describes the type of variable a function receives. An argument is the specific input.

Researched answer: A parameter is the variable within the function (doesn't necessarily describe the data type), where as the argument is the data that is passed into the function.

2. The JavaScript built in method .map() takes predefined parameters. What are they? Which are required and which are optional?

Your answer: .map() takes the value of an array, the index, and the array the function is called on. The value is required but index and array are optional.

Researched answer: The syntax for .map() is array.map(function(currentValue, index, arr), thisValue).

3. What is the difference between map and filter?

Your answer: .map() iterates through an array and returns a new array with the values altered in some way. .filter() iterates through an array and evaluates if each value fits a certain set of standards, then returns an array containing only those values.

Researched answer: Both return new arrays without altering the original array.

4. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iteration is the repetition of an action, like in a loop.

Researched answer: Iteration is used to access each value within an array.

5. What is the difference between a function and a method?

Your answer: Like a function, a method completes an action but it is associated with a specific object. Methods are built-in.

Researched answer: A method is a type of function.

6. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: Hoisting is the behavior of moving all declaration to the top of the current scope so a variable can be used earlier in the code than it was declared.

Researched answer: Let and const variables cannot be used until they are declared.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Spread operator: An operator that copies an existing array into a new array using (...)

2. React state: State is a built-in object within React that conatins data about a component.

3. DOM events: A built-in event in React that happens once an action is taken by the user (I think)
